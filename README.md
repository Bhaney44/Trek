TREK_Coalition_Prototype

This is a prototype of an Electronic Healthcare Record Management System developed to digitize healthcare records for indiginous people in the Andes Mountain Region of Ecuador. I developed this pro bono project to help improve the quality of care available to Trek patients by creating a mechanism to record patient data in an accessible format. This prototype lead Trek Management to invest in developing a full-scale EHR system. For more on Trek, check out their website @http://trekcoalition.org/.
